    				As a left-handed girl who loves to listen to music and watch videos on her phone, my dream is to make recreational life easier and more convenient. 
    				<br><br>
    				Iâ€™m currently an UIUX designer at a Social Tech Startup. In the future, I hope to join music streaming service companies in Taiwan  to improve product features and user experience, and attract more people to use domestic platforms. 
    				<br><br>
    				Besides work, I would also like to create a public participation mechanism that can actually benefit the practical level through Service Design, for instance, helping residents discover and gain a sense of culture identity would enable people to care more about their hometown, to bond stronger with people and to connect human with land.  
    				<br><br>
    				Adhering to the human-centered design concept, creating integrated solutions through cross-professional collaboration and communication and taking beauty and practicality into account are my core competence.</p>
